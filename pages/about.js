            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I first started to become interested in computers when I was at the young age of 
                    10. From there I go involved in the modding community in Counter Strike Source,
                    an online first person shooter, where you can host your own server and make it
                    into anything you want. I was trying to have my own server with an RPG mod that
                    was written JavaScript. I ran into many issues since I had no idea how to program,
                    and no idea where to start. It eventually lead me to researching and learning what I
                    needed to run the mod and my desire to research and learn was sparked.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I was originally interested in studying mechincal engineering, since I love making things.
                    From designing, to prototyping, to making the final product, I loved every second of it.
                    I then became interested in computer science since the aspects of problem solving, designing,
                    and coming to a magnificent solution. I had no clear direction of what I specifically wanted to do
                    so I wanted to be versitile.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Then I found myself in the web application development class at Grand Valley State University.
                    I fell in love with it. The ability to develop an application that is robust and used everywhere amazed me.
                    I needed to know more, I wanted to know more, I had to learn more. Thus resulting in where I am today. The ability
                    to pick up a language, or framework in a couple hours and use it to develop a web app as long as I had documentation
                    handy. I've developed full stack applications such as a basic ToDo app with ASP.NET, an achievement tracker with Vue,
                    Firebase Database, and Firebase auth, and a JAMstack website using React and Next.js.
